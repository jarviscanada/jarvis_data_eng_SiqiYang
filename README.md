# Siqi Yang . Jarvis Consulting

I recently graduated from the University of Toronto St. George with a Specialist in Computer Science and a minor in mathematics. Through 4 years' studies, I gained plenty of valuable experiences in computer science. During the University, I completed several front end and back end projects. These experiences helped me become a team-oriented, detail-oriented, responsible person. I'm passionate about learning new technology and always looking for new challenges. Currently, I am working for Jarvis company and mainly responsible for building several big data-related projects including Java, SQL, Springboot. Also, I'm responsible for performing the scrum methodology to ensure the success of the projects by fulfilling the requirements. During leisure, I enjoy playing basketball and team video games. It helps me develop solid communication skills and a team-oriented personality.

- **[Cluster Monitor](./linux_sql)**:Developed an internal tool that monitors the cluster resources such as hardware information, and some usage data every one minute for each network node that is connected by a switch.Used two bash-scripts to collect the information from each host and store the data in the Database.Utilized the docker container to provision the database.
- **[Core Java Apps](./core_java)**:Developed three Java projects. The first one is about simulating the grep command functionality using Java. It uses the lambda function and stream API from Java to optimize the final project performance. Then the second one is the JDBC application, It uses JDBC to build a connection between Java and Postgres SQL database. It implements CRUD(create, read, update, delete) operations by using the Data Access Object(DAO) design pattern. The third project is about using Twitter REST API to create a Java application. This Java application allows users to create, delete, and find a specific tweet. It uses MVC(Model–view–controller) design pattern to manage the code structure and Spring framework to manage the dependency relationship.
